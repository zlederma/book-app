# Book App

Book App is a frontend focused project done in JavaScript React that utilizes the Google Books API to allow users to search for a book and manage their library. It also has a Discover section filled with some of my favorite books, so I recommend checking them out! For the minimum viable product (current stage) version of this project, I deliberately chose to keep the tech stack and feature-list light. This allowed me to focus my energy on bolstering my skills in fundamental development concepts â€“ writing clean and organized code, paying attention to naming conventions, using Git version control effectively, and styling in CSS.
